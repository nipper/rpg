The world is going through a period of expansion. The original [Empire](Campaigns/Mistvale/History/Empire.md) fell a few centuries in the past. The empire fractured into a variety of baronies lead by a [Vestarch](Glossary.md#Vestarch).  As time went on they fractured even more, with the remenents of power that each Vestarch held disapearing.

The current power structure is a group of merchant guilds, each who control a variety of markets and towns and trade routes.

Recently the various kingdoms, city states and pretender vestarch's have started to expand back to the eastern realms of the former empire. It's an area that has gone uninhabiated by (demi)-humans
