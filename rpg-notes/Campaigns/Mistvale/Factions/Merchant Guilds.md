The merchant guilds are the current dominant set of factions in the world. They exist outside of the of the normal geographic boundaries of kingdoms, vestarcharies and free states. There are 3-4 major houses and a myriad of minor ones hoping to move up to the big leagues. 

Most guilds have offices in most cities and headquarter's in 2-3 major areas. They all have a particular focus, but all will trade in whatever they can.
